# groundcover_dataintegration (Resource)

DataIntegration resource for managing groundcover's integrations with external services such as cloud providers, databases and more. This resource is composed of general metadata on the integration and a specific configuration per data source. Navigate to the relevant nested schema according to your specific needs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    groundcover = {
      source = "groundcover-com/groundcover"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the groundcover Provider
provider "groundcover" {
  # api_key can be set via the GROUNDCOVER_API_KEY environment variable
  # backend_id can be set via the GROUNDCOVER_BACKEND_ID environment variable
  # api_url can be set via the GROUNDCOVER_API_URL environment variable (optional)
}

# Example: CloudWatch DataIntegration
# For a full list of supported AWS metrics and statistics, visit the official CloudWatch documentation:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html
resource "groundcover_dataintegration" "cloudwatch_example" {
  type = "cloudwatch"
  config = jsonencode({
    name      = "test-cloudwatch"
    version   = 1
    stsRegion = "us-east-1"
    regions   = ["us-east-1", "us-east-2"]
    roleArn   = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/test-role"
    awsMetrics = [
      {
        namespace = "AWS/EC2"
        metrics = [
          {
            name       = "CPUUtilization"
            statistics = ["Average"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    labelSettings = {
      extraLabels = ["env", "prod"]
    }
  })
  is_paused = false
}

# Output the data integration IDs for reference
