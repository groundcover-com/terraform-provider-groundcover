# groundcover_secret (Resource)

Manages a groundcover Secret.

Secrets allow you to securely store sensitive values (like API keys, passwords, or credentials) and receive a reference ID that can be used in other resources (such as data integrations and synthetics) as a placeholder instead of the actual secret value.

**Note:** The secret content is write-only and will not be returned by the API after creation. The content is stored in the Terraform state (encrypted if using a remote backend with encryption).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Variables for secret content
variable "external_api_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "External service API key"
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "database_password" {
  type        = string
  description = "Database password"
  sensitive   = true
}

# Example: Create an API key secret
resource "groundcover_secret" "api_key_example" {
  name    = "my-external-api-key"
  type    = "api_key"
  content = var.external_api_key
}

# Example: Create a password secret
resource "groundcover_secret" "password_example" {
  name    = "database-password"
  type    = "password"
  content = var.database_password
}

# The secret ID can be used in other resources like data integrations 
output "api_key_secret_id" {
  description = "The reference ID for the API key secret. Use this in other resources."
  value       = groundcover_secret.api_key_example.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String, Sensitive) The secret content/value. This is write-only and will not be returned by the API.
- `name` (String) The name of the secret.
- `type` (String) The type of the secret. Valid values are: `api_key`, `password`, `basic_auth`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique reference ID for the secret. Use this ID in other resources (e.g., data integrations, synthetics, etc.) as a placeholder for the secret value.

## Import

Secrets can be imported using their ID, but note that the `content` attribute cannot be retrieved and must be set in your configuration after import:

```shell
terraform import groundcover_secret.example secretRef::store::a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

After importing, you must update your Terraform configuration to include the `content` value, as it cannot be read from the API.
